# mykeyboard
This is a passion project built with several benefits in mind: practicing HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript; creating a tool to educate the alphabet to my children; and for demoing at Girls Who Code Summer Program 2019 in Wilmington, DE. 

All of the code and media in this application is custom by Dawn Milnamow.
